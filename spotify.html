										<h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
										<p>Given the variety present in today’s charts it can be difficult to recognise what it is
										exactly that makes certain songs so successful – is it the liveliness of a track, maybe the 
										energy that it brings to a room or perhaps the positivity within its lyrics? Up until recent years 
										we had no way of calculating this but given the digitalization of music over the past number of years 
										we now have audio metrics that we can use to shed some light on these questions.</br></br>										
										The aim of this project is to see how accurately we can predict a tracks popularity based on its various <i>audio features</i> by using 
										a wide variety of complex machine learning models. I will also examine trends in popular music and identify how 
										this has changed over the previous three decades.
										<!-- Each model will be applied to each target dataset before  -->
										<!-- being evaluated based off the three evaluation metrics. Each model will then be compared against the other  -->
										<!-- six machine learning models based on how well they performed on the same dataset to conclude which model  -->
										<!-- is the best for that given dataset. -->
										<h2 class="major">Data Acquisition & Preprocessing</h2>
										<p>In order to obtain the necessary data Spotify's API was utilized. This allowed me to pull data on 60,000 songs spanning
										across three decades. Two separate API calls were required for each year. The first
										call pulled song data such as <i>name</i>, <i>unique id</i>, and <i>artist name</i>. The second call used the unique id
										to pull the audio feature data for each song such as <i>energy, tempo, key, </i>etc. Once complete, the two 
										datasets were joined on the <i>id</i> feature. A conscious decision was made to perform the merge using an 
										inner join. In doing so, a small number of tracks that did not contain audio features data were dropped from
										the dataset as they would not be useful.</p>
										<p>The below function was used to perform the process described above once the initial API connection had been
										successfully authorized.</p>

									<p>At this point I noticed that despite pulling data on what we initially believed 
									was 60,000 tracks, both datasets noughtiesTracks and tensTracks contained more than 20,000 
									tracks while ninetiesTracks contained exactly 20,000, as expected. tensTracks contained 21,040
									records while noughtiesTracks contained 23,056 records. Upon further examination I found that 
									many duplicate tracks were being pulled from Spotify during the tracks features API request. This
									was found by grouping records firstly by the <i>id</i> field and secondly by the <i>artist_name</i> and 
									<i>track_name</i> simultaneously. All duplicate records were then dropped using Pandas <i>drop_duplicates</i>
									function
									</p>
									
									<pre><code>
# drop duplicates of records with same track_id
tracks.drop_duplicates(subset=['track_id'], inplace=True)

# drop duplicates of records with same artist and track name
tracks.drop_duplicates(subset=['artist_name','track_name'], inplace=True)
									</pre></code>
									
									<p>Next, I dropped any columns which would not provide any predictive capability to the machine learning 
									models. The following columns were removed; <i>uri, track_href</i>, and <i>analysis_url.</i>
									<pre><code>
tracks.drop(['type','uri','track_href','analysis_url','time_signature'], 1, inplace=True)
									</pre></code>
									</p>
									<p>The final step of data preprocessing required the <i>key</i> feature to be transformed as it was categorical
									data that would not be understood by the machine learning algorithms. This feature was transformed using one-hot 
									encoding as I felt this was the optimal way to handle a categorical feature containing twelve levels. Again, this was
									easily done using Pandas <i>get_dummies</i> function. 
									<pre><code>
tracks = pd.get_dummies(tracks, columns=["key"])
									</pre></code>
									</p>
									
									</section>
									
									<p> Lastly, in order to determine the change in trends of popular music over time the dataset was sliced into three separate datasets
									according to the tracks release date. This also allowed me to test the machine learning models across three large datasets
									and gain a better understanding of which one performs best. The three datasets were titled:
												<ol>
													<li><i>tensTracks</i> - Tracks released between 2010-2019</li>
													<li><i>noughtiesTracks</i> - Tracks released between 2000-2009</li>
													<li><i>ninetiesTracks</i> - Tracks released between 1990-1999</li>
												</ol>
									</p>	
									
									<h2 class="major">Machine Learning Implementation</h2>
									<p>Now that the data has been acquired and preprocessed we will look at how the machine learning models were
									fitted to the datasets. As I was curious to test many different models, I opted to implement and evaluate 
									the performance of the following seven machine learning techniques on the datasets;
									
												<ul>
													<li>Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression</li>
													<li>Support Vector Regression (SVR)</li>
													<li>Ridge Regression.</li>
													<li>Lasso Regression</li>
													<li>Random Forest Regression</li>
													<li>k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) Regression</li>
													<li>Artificial Neural Network (ANN)</li>
												</ul>
												
									
									
									</p>
									<p>
									To ensure consistency, all models with the exception of ANN model were fitted following
									the same steps. Firstly, the datasets were split into training and testing datasets using a
									70/30 split.</br>
									<pre><code>
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=101) 
									</pre></code>
									Following this, GridSearch cross-validation was	used to determine the optimal values for a number of 
									hyperparameters across each of the models as per the resulting 𝑅&sup2; value. Given this method can be 
									computationally intensive GridSearch was only run on the
									hyperparameters which were deemed to be of most importance to the model and its performance. Once the
									optimal hyperparameters were calculated, the model was then fitted to the dataset using the given hyperparameters.
									Below is an example snippet of GridSearch cross-validation being performed across two example hyperparameters - 
									<i>n_estimators</i> and <i>bootstrap</i>.</br></br>
									<pre><code>
grid_param = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 300, 500], #'example hyperparameter': [possibility 1, possibility 2, etc]
    'bootstrap': [True, False]
}

gd_sr = GridSearchCV(estimator=regressor,
                     param_grid=grid_param,
                     scoring='r2', #use r2 as the evaluation metric
                     cv=5,
                     n_jobs=-1)

gd_sr.fit(X_train, y_train) #fit the model to testing data

optimum_parameters = gd_sr.best_params_

									<p>The models performance is measured using three evaluation metrics - 𝑅&sup2;, mean absolute error (MAE),
									and root mean squared error (RMSE). Each model will then be compared against the other six machine 
									learning models based on how well they performed on the same dataset to conclude which model is the
									best for that given dataset. Following that, I will examine each datasets correlation to the 
									<i>popularity</i> feature in order to determine which musical features hold the strongest relationship,
									and how has this changed since the nineties.

									<p>Random Forest performed the best across all three evaluation metrics on this dataset.
									Notably, ANN also came second across all three metrics.	This was then closely followed by SVR before
									the results of the other three models all drop off. Undoubtedly, Random Forest was the most suitable
									model for this particular dataset. Next we will examine this datasets correlation between the target variable
									<i>popularity</i> and the predictor variables.
									</p>
									<p>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image left"><img src="images/tensTracksCorr.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									It is clear the strongest positively correlated relationship between the audio features and <i>popularity</i> 
									exists with the two variables <i>danceability</i> and <i>loudness</i>. This tell us that the louder and more “danceable”
									a song is perceived, the more likely it is to receive a higher popularity value. The audio feature, 
									<i>instrumentalness</i> appears to be strongly negatively correlated which implies that in the decade that
									ran from 2010-2019, songs with less vocals tended to be more popular. None of the other independent variables
									have a correlation strong enough to be of note, particularly all the encoded <i>key</i> variables.

										<p>In this case the best 𝑅&sup2; value again belonged to Random Forest Regression. Random Forest 
										also recorded the lowest RMSE of the group at 20.97. This time the lowest MAE was recorded by 
										SVR at 16.5. ANN performed well again with all three metrics slightly below Random Forest. 
										kNN was also close, coming up just slightly behind ANN on the three metrics. Lastly, the 
										three models PLS Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression all delivered very similar 
										evaluation metrics which performed the worst of the bunch.
										</p>
										<div class="col-4"><span class="image right"><img src="images/noughtiesTracksCorr.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										<p>Despite SVR scoring the highest on one of the evaluation metrics, Random Forest still 
										performed the best across this dataset with its superior 𝑅&sup2; and RMSE values when compared
										against the other models. We can conclude that Random Forest is undoubtedly the most
										suitable for the noughtiesTracks dataset. Next, we will examine the correlation in this 
										dataset between <i>popularity</i> and the other variables. 
										</p>
										<p>
										As seen in the graph to the right, <i>instrumentalness</i> is the most strongly negatively 
										correlated variable with <i>popularity</i>. We can conclude from this that the less vocals in 
										a track makes it more likely to rank higher on the popularity metric. We can also see a positive
										correlation with both <i>loudness</i> and a slight one with <i>valence</i>. This tell us that 
										the louder a track is, and the happier it is perceived to be, the more likely it is to return a 
										favourable <i>popularity</i> during this decade between 2000-2009.

										<p>A massive decrease was observed in performance across all seven of the machine learning models
										based off the 𝑅&sup2; value while both MAE and RMSE have improved significantly. Similar to the
										second dataset Random Forest returned the best 𝑅&sup2; value and RMSE while SRV returned the best
										MAE of 7.33. In terms of 𝑅&sup2; , ANN is just behind again with a value of 0.03 compared with
										Random Forests 0.04. In this case Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and PLS all performed very
										similarly and, in this case, outperformed SVR in terms of 𝑅&sup2; value and kNN across all three
										evaluation metrics.
										</p>
										<div class="col-4"><span class="image left"><img src="images/ninetiesTracksCorr.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										<p>Overall, Random Forest is yet again the best suited given that it scored the highest in two of
										the metrics and was the second highest for the third metric. Interestingly, ANN fell to the
										worst RMSE and second worst MAE. It is also noteworthy that the previous worst performing models,
										Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and PLS, all outperformed SVR in both their 𝑅&sup2; and RMSE values.
										</p>
										<p>Looking at the correlation graph to the right we can see <i>loudness</i> is strongest positively 
										correlated audio feature while <i>instrumentalness</i> and <i>acousticness</i> are the two strongest 
										negatively correlated audio features. This tells us that loud music tended to perform better in the nineties
										while music that was not acoustic or instrumental, also did well.

								<h2 class="major">Conclusions</h2>	
								<p>A clear conclusion can be drawn from this that Random Forest is the best performing machine learning model based
								on the three target datasets given that it outperformed the other models on 7/9 occasions. While it was the best
								 performing, it had a wide variety of 𝑅&sup2; results, ranging from 0.51 to 0.04 across the three target datasets. 
								 To conclude you could say this model can be used to predict song popularity in certain eras. It seemed to work well
								 in years 2010-2019, not so well in 2000-2009, then poorly in 1990-1999. 
								</p>
								<p>Observing our correlation graphs across the three decades we can begin to see some patterns. The correlation of 
								the variable <i>energy</i> changed from positive to negative over the three decades. This would imply that the level
								of energy in popular music has decreased over the previous three decades.The <i>instrumentalness</i> variable became
								more negatively correlated as the decades progressed. This indicates that the amount of vocals in popular 
								tracks has decreased over the three decades. This may be as a result of electronic music becoming more popular.
								The variable <i>duration_ms</i> changed from positively correlated to negatively correlated as the decades progressed. 
								This indicates popular tracks have become shorter as time has gone on.
